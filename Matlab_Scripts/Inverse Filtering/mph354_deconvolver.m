function mph354_deconvolver(sigFilename,irFilename, filename, smoothing)
%MPH354_DECONVOLVER function made by Michael Hagen- MPH354
%
%   This function deconvolves an input audio wile using an input impulse
%   response, thereby removing the spectral and time components that the
%   system characterized by the impulse response added (or would/will add).
%   This function uses fast deconvolution and smoothing to achive a fast and
%   practical deconvolution process for any system, but was specifically 
%   designed for headphones.
%   
%   Arguments should be the Signal Filename, the Impulse Response Filename,
%   the Output Filename, and the amount of smoothing to be used (0.0-1.0)
%
%   sigFilename: the filename of the signal to be used in the
%       deconvolution
%   irFilename: the filename of the impulse response to be used in the 
%       convolution
%   filename: The filename of the deconvolved audio to be written to disk
%   smoothing (optional): The amount of smoothing to be done, must be a value between
%   0.0 and 1.0. Will default to a value of 0.02 if not specified.

%
%   EXAMPLE
%           Below is an example of how to use the function to create
%           'compensated.wav', the deconvolution of audio.wav and
%           ir1.wav, using a smoothing factor of 0.02.
%
